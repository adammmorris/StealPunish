Ok, lit1 seems to have been a version that had a bug involving lots of undefined data.

lit1p1 was a game where the person could steal or not steal.  Their opponent could always punish theft "#pun" or never "#nopun".  (# indicates which face/name was paired with which strategy).

lit2 was a game where the person could punish or not punish (theft).  Their opponent could either contingently cease stealing after punished "#con" or non-contingently persist in theft despite punishent "#inc".

I'm not sure about lit2p1 -- maybe the same with a different payoff matrix?

In lit3 participants played both roles -- thief and punisher.  Among opponents, "pun" would always punish theft, "suc" was a sucker (?) who never punished theft, "con" was a contingent non-stealer, and "non" was a non-contingent always-stealer.  (I think?)

Note that, throughout, the number of interactions per opponent varied, often between 2 and 10.
