GAME:
Payoffs are 2.5,-1,???,-2.5
Values = [0, -1, -1.5, -2, -2.5, -5, -10, -50]
Bs = 10, Bp = 5 (reversed in B's)
probBackTurned = 0
numGames = 1000

AGENT PARAMS:
min bias = 0, max bias = 4, paramStep = 1, numParams = 2
These just represent the 5x5 matrix of 1-back strategies (plus learning)

ALGORITHM:
numGenerations = 5000
temp = 20
mutation = 0
