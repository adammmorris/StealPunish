GAME:
Payoffs are 1,-1,-.5,???
Values = [-1,-1.5,-2,-3,-3.5,-5,-10,-50]
Bs = 10, Bp = 5 (reversed in B's)
probBackTurned = 0
numGames = 1000

AGENT PARAMS:
min bias = 0, max bias = 4, paramStep = 1, numParams = 2
These just represent the 5x5 matrix of 1-back strategies (plus learning)

ALGORITHM:
numGenerations = 5000
temp = 20
mutation = 0
